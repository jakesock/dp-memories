# DINOSAUR PLANET MEMORIES

## About

- This is an app for my friends!
- I wanted to practice the social media aspect of an application I am working on using the MERN stack with Redux, so this is that practice!

## Issues

- There are a lot of issues with this, but as it is a project made to practice for an upcoming project, I won't be adding much or fixing it frequently.
- There is no use authentication in place, so every time someone posts they have to enter their name.
- The lack of authentication also means that a user can like, edit, and delete anyones post as many times as they want. Authentication is something I want more practice with, so I hope to implement some authentication flow with this soon!
