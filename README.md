# DINOSAUR PLANET MEMORIES

## About

- This is an app for my friends!

## TODO

- [ ] Add "Liked" vs "Not Liked" styles for like button
- [ ] Make FormError component for form errors

- [ ] Make Snackbar component for general messages
- [ ] Place Snackbar component and pass several error, success, and info props for general alerting where needed
- [ ] Fix layout on super small screens
- [ ] Clear error state in various portions of the application, no need to have past errors hanging around in the store
- [ ] Style the "Already have an account?" and "Don't have an account?" messages on the Auth Forms
- [ ] Go through entirety of code base and make her beautiful (remove console logs and unused vars, seperate components where it makes sense, organize import statements, reduce unnecessary component-level state if applicable, etc.)
- [ ] Build and deploy v2

### TODO (FUTURE)
